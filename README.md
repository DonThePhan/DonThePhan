# Donny Phan

Hi! I'm from Canada and have been programming during our Corona Vacation starting November of 2020. 
I've taken a deep interest in solving problems with technology ever since and have been gravitating toward UI, it's really a brand new door for me.

I hope you find something here that inspires you!

Feel free to drop my a line! I'd love to get some ideas moving.

### 💻 Currently working in:

* 🚲 Biking and tuning up bikes are my newest hobby!
* 🕺 My passion is social dancing
* ✈️ Travelling seems to coincide with my dancing
* 🚐 Recent shenanigans include vanlifing in the late summer
* 🛠️ I love building things
